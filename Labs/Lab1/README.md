# Packaging an IP(AXI Peripheral)

* Create a new project and add the pattern detector .v file. It has a 3 bit pattern to be detected in the 32 bit input. (Refer Figure 1) The output is the number of occurrences of the pattern stored in the 32 bit output register. Note: The pattern detector .v file is verified with post synthesis simulation.
