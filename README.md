# RISC-V-On-FPGA-Labs

This repository consists of the following:

* Project files (Vivado) for the Pinaka SoC with Shakti 32-bit microprocessor targeting Arty A7 boards (Arty A7-35(default) and A7-100) <br/>

* Tutorial(Labs) that demonstrates:

  1. Running a C code using spike simulator and measure the clock cycles.  

  2. Programming the SoC to the board using Vivado.  

  3. Running a C code on Shakti microprocessor and measure the clock cycles.  

  4. Design and packaging a custom IP(AXI peripheral) for the SoC.  

  5. Running a C code on Shakti microprocessor, that has our custom packaged IP with the SoC.
